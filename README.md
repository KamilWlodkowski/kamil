- 👋 Hi, I’m @KamilW
- 👀 I am interested in working as a junior java developer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JAVA. In the future, I would also like to expand my technical skills with programming languages such as Kotlin and Python, as I would ultimately like to program Android applications natively and increase my knowledge in the subject of Machine Learning. 
- 💞️ In my free time, I arrange Rubik's cube and its variances and solve logic puzzles.
